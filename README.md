## 42 Projects
### ‚úÖ [libft][libft-gnl-printf]
- A collection of C functions that are often used in various 42 projects.
- Functions include a mix of standard C library functions and additional utility functions.
  
### ‚úÖ [ft_printf][libft-gnl-printf]
- Efficiently reads a line from a file or standard input until a newline character is encountered.
- Handles multiple file descriptors simultaneously.
  
### ‚úÖ [get_next_line][libft-gnl-printf]
- Replicates (parts of) the ```printf``` function from the standard C library ```libc```.
 
### ‚úÖ born2beroot
- tba.
- tba.

### ‚úÖ [fdf][fdf]
- working with the API of [a graphics library](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux)
- understanding points in 2 and 3 dimensional space, vectors and trigonometric functions
- [Bresenham's line algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm)
- Using a [rotation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix) to transform coordinates

|Project|Status|Description|
|:---|:---:|---|
|[libft][libft-gnl-printf]|:white_check_mark:|Recode some functions from the standard C library, as well as some other utility functions that will be useful later on in the cursus.|
|[ft_printf][libft-gnl-printf]|:white_check_mark:|Recode the libc‚Äôs printf function.|
|[get_next_line][libft-gnl-printf]|:white_check_mark:|Write a function which returns a line read from a file descriptor, without the newline.|
|born2beroot|:white_check_mark:|Install a Virtual Machine, discover the basics of system and network administration as well as a few services often used on a server machine.|
|[fdf][fdf]|:white_check_mark:|Create a simplified 3D graphic representation of a relief landscape.|
|[push_swap][push_swap]|:white_check_mark:|Sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions.|
|[minitalk][minitalk]|:white_check_mark:|Create a communication program in the form of a client and server using UNIX signals.|
|[philosophers][philosophers]|:white_check_mark:|Write a program that simulates the life of a group of philosophers to learn the basics of threading a process an mutexes.|
|[minishell][frankenshell]|:white_check_mark:|Recreate the bash shell. This is a huge project, so you should go check it out. ;) |
|[cub3D][cub3D]|:white_check_mark:|Create a 3D game in C using raycasting.|
|NetPractice|:building_construction:|NetPractice is a general practical exercise to let you discover networking in a playful way. The goal is to configure small-scale networks (TCP/IP, Subnetting, Routing, etc.) and to make them work.|
|[CPPs][CPPs]|:building_construction:|tba.|
|webserv|:building_construction:|tba.|
|Inception|:building_construction:|tba.|
|ft_transcendence|:building_construction:|tba.|
